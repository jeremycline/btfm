# Setup

Download the [deepspeech build for your
platform](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/tag/v0.6.1), along
with the
[models](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.6.1/deepspeech-0.6.1-models.tar.gz).

Set up your paths so that deepspeech can be found by the compiler (or drop it into /usr/local/lib/ and run ldconfig).

Install make, autotools, the libopus headers, and the libsodium headers.
